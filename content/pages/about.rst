    Hi, I'm Francisco!

    I'm currently a Computer Vision Data Scientist at CCC, where I
    work on combining photo and telematics data to enhance our suite of AI-enabled vehicle
    collision estimating tools.

    I received my Master's in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Illinois at
    Urbana-Champaign  where explored the applications of deep learning to computational
    modeling. Since then I've been passionate about teaching computers how to learn
    from images, simulations, and other complex and dynamic data.
