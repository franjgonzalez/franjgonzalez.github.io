Hi, I'm Francisco. I'm a Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm currently exploring the
applications of deep learning to computational modeling. My other research
interests include dynamical systems, computational fluid mechanics,
high-performance computing, and machine learning in general.
