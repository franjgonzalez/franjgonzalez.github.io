import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Originally trained in Aerospace Engineering at <a href="https://aerospace.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>UIUC</Underlining>,</a> I made my way to machine learning via fluid dynamics and high-performance computing.

Currently, I'm a senior data scientist @ <a href="https://strong.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>strong.io</Underlining></a> ðŸ’ª where I help companies design, develop, and deploy custom machine learning and AI products. I generally focus on computer vision and deep learning, but I'm always excited to tackle new challenges.

Aside from data science, you can find me training for my next triathlon or developing and scanning my film negatives.
