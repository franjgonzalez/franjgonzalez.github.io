import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Originally trained in Aerospace Engineering at  the <a href="https://ae.illinois.edu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</Underlining></a>, I made my way to data science via fluid mechanics and high-performance computing.

Currently, I'm a data scientist @ <a href="https://strong.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>strong.io</Underlining></a> where I help companies design, develop, and deploy custom machine learning and AI products. I generally focus on computer vision and deep learning, but I'm always excited to tackle new challenges.

Aside from data science, you can find me training for my next triathlon or developing and scanning my film negatives.
