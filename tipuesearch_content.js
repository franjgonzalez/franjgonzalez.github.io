I help companies design, develop, and integrate computer vision and deep learning products and solutions. Previously I worked for an insurtech company where I developed machine learning tools that leverage image and telematics data for vehicle claims automation. I received my Master's in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I explored the applications of deep learning to computational modeling of large scale dynamical systems. Since then I've been passionate about teaching computers how to learn from images, simulations, and other complex and dynamic data.","tags":"pages","url":"/pages/about.html","loc":"/pages/about.html"},{"title":"Publications","text":"Publications 2018 Gonzalez, F. , Balajewicz, M.
