- name: Cerbero
  descr: "Cerbero is an open-source multi-task learning library, built on PyTorch. It's
  based on <a class='reference external' href='https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel'>Snorkel</a>'s
  multi-task classification modeling framework. However, after Snorkel dropped support
  for their open-source library recently, we at
  <a class='reference external' href='https://www.strong.io/'>Strong</a> have
  decided to develop our own stipped-down multi-task learning framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, the goal is for Cerbero to make building and training complex multi-task
  models easy and intuitive. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

- name: <i>neural</i> Model Order Reduction
  descr: "nMOR is an open-source deep learning framework for model reduction of general
  dynamical systems, built on TensorFlow. By now it definitely has the aura of a
  neglected <i>research-y</i> codebase and is definitely in need of a refresh. Some
  ideas for future work here include:
  <ul>
    <li>Refactor and update to TensorFlow 2.x (or PyTorch?)</li>
    <li>Add a couple of example applications</li>
    <li>Add more documentation</li>
  </ul>
