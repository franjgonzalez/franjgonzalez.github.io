  <p>Hi, I'm Francisco, though I sometimes go by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho">Panch</a>.
  I'm currently a Data Science Consultant based in Chicago.</p>
  <p>In a previous life, I used deep learning and simulation data to make computational
  physics more efficient. I now help companies design, develop, and integrate computer
  vision and deep learning solutions.</p>
