Hi, I'm Francisco. I sometimes go by [Panch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho) hence
the domain name.

I'm a data scientist based in Chicago. Initially trained in aerospace engineering and
computational physics, I now spend most of my time working on deep learning and computer
vision.

This page is a bit bare at the moment, but I'm hoping to fill it with interesting tidbits
on deep learning, computer vision, computational science, and dynamical systems. Eventually,
it might be interspersed with non-technical ramblings.

Welcome!
